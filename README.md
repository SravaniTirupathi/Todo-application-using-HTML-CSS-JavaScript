Todo applications are used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list of everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. This todo application mainly contains three properties :
Add tasks
Read tasks
Delete tasks
Add tasks: Add the tasks that we want to de.
Read tasks: Added tasks can be readed.
Delete tasks: Once the task is completed we can delete the task from the todo list.
